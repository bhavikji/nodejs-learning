Event Loop Cycle

1. Timers (Execute setTimeout, setInterval Callbacks)
2. Pending Callbacks (Execute I/O related Callbacks that were deferred)
3. Poll (Retrieve new I/O events, and execute their Callbacks, it will check for timers and can jump there if any timer is needed to be execute)
4. Check (execute just after Poll once the execution is complete it will execute setImmediate callback).
5. Close Callbacks (execute all 'close' event callback)
6. process.exit (exit the event loop only when there are no remaining event handlers which are registered tracked via refs, refs==0)


In case of createServer, we always have one reference therefore process.exit won't be called as the refs will never be zero.
